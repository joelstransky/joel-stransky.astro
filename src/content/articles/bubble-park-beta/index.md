When my kids asked me to make a game with them, I knew I was in trouble. They're Roblox fanatics, and I'd never touched the platform. But after some initial tinkering with the editor, I discovered something that changed everything: a thriving community building Roblox games using TypeScript and React. Suddenly, I was all in.

I wanted to create something where the gameplay emerged naturally from physics, so marble racing seemed like the perfect fit. You knowâ€”place your bets, watch chaos unfold. But then I thought: what if you *were* the marble? And what if you could drive it?

The learning curve hit me like a truck. Roblox is multiplayer by default, which means constant client-server communication and a whole new way of thinking about game architecture. I spent weeks wrapping my head around remote events, data stores, and keeping everything in sync across players.

The current beta features just the first two areas, but I've built the foundation to expand significantly from here. If you've got a Roblox fan in your life (or are one yourself), I'd love for you to check it out and share your feedback.

Sometimes the best projects are the ones your kids rope you into.
